# Our Workflow
## Branching
It's possible to have to work on different features as a team so we have defined rules to name our branch :
- feature/{topic}
- enhancement/{topic} *for improvement of a feature*
- fix/{topic} *fix a problem / bug*
- doc/{topic}

## Merge or Rebase 
We use rebase instead of merge when we merge branch in develop. 

## Realease
We use git tag to identify version of our app and release system of GITHUB to notify changes between versions.
